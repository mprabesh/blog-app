# Blog Application Build and Deployment Script
# ===================================================================
#
# This script automates the complete build and deployment process for
# the containerized blog application. It handles:
#
# Features:
# - Environment validation and setup
# - Docker image building for both services
# - Service orchestration with Docker Compose
# - Health checks and status monitoring
# - User-friendly progress indicators and error handling
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Docker and Docker Compose installed
# - .env file with required environment variables
# - Source code in blog-list/ and bloglist-frontend/ directories
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                    # Build and deploy entire application
#   chmod +x build.sh             # Make script executable (first time)
#
# Output:
# - Backend API running on port 8081
# - Frontend web app running on port 3001
# - Docker containers with health checks enabled
# ===================================================================

# Enable strict error handling
# -e: Exit immediately if any command fails
# This ensures the script stops on errors rather than continuing
set -e

echo "üöÄ Building Blog Application..."

# ===================================================================
# Environment Configuration Check
# ===================================================================
# Verify that required environment file exists before proceeding.
# If .env doesn't exist, create it from template and prompt user.
if [ ! -f .env ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  .env file not found. Creating from template..."

    echo "üìù Please edit .env with your actual values before running again."

# Load environment variables from .env file into current shell session
# This makes variables available for Docker Compose variable substitution
source .env

# ===================================================================
# Service Building and Deployment Phase
# ===================================================================
# Build and deploy all services using Docker Compose orchestration.
# This handles image building, networking, dependencies, and health checks.

echo "üê≥ Building and starting services with Docker Compose..."
# Build images and start all services in detached mode (-d)
# Docker Compose will handle:
# - Building images with proper build arguments (including VITE_API_URL)
# - Service dependencies and health checks
# - Network configuration between services
docker compose up -d --build

# Note: Frontend environment variables (VITE_*) are processed at build time
# and baked into the static files. They cannot be changed at runtime.

# ===================================================================
# Health Check and Verification Phase
# ===================================================================
# Wait for services to initialize and verify they're running correctly.

echo "‚è≥ Waiting for services to be healthy..."
# Allow time for containers to start and pass health checks
# Backend must be healthy before frontend starts (dependency)
sleep 10

# Check service health and display status
echo "üîç Checking service status..."
# Display container status, health, and port mappings
docker compose ps

# ===================================================================
# Deployment Success Information
# ===================================================================
# Provide user with access URLs and management commands.
